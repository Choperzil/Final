            Hello everyone, I'm Choperzil Johny, a normal pupil from FPT univertsity. By learning 
            about the front-end I can do basic website although it still have some problems
            and it doesn't look pretty. Still, I'm enjoyed making the website by myself and impove
            my skill more. I make this website to upload some of my project that I have made in the 
            course like an album. In the future, when I become a pro in front-end, I will go through
            all of my first projects to see my growth in web design. I have nothing to say more. 
            Have a good day!:>>>
